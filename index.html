                <p>Mullah Mohammed Omar foundation, Taliban is not just a group of Talib (students) educated in
                    traditional Islamic Schools that represents a section of Afghanistan provinces that took over Kabul
                    in 1996 just after two years of its formation and dislodged in 2001 by U.S. It is more diversified
                    with the involvement of different Islamic ethnic groups, more radical religiously, more handy number
                    wise, more powerful logistically and of course the more confident after what has been the recent
                    progressions.</p>
                <p>
                    From the Bush regime to the Biden administration Taliban has only gained, if not power but the
                    resilience, that is now gaining momentum. Yes it lost its men, but it wasn’t the Taliban alone that
                    had faced this kind of loss. Who would have thought that a radical Islamic terrorist group that
                    started with just 50 talibs will withstand counterinsurgency operations from the world’s most
                    powerful security alliance the NATO (The North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and 3 U.S
                    administrations in a war that will take the lives of 6,000 U.S troops and 1,100 NATO personnel.
                    Along with that 46,000 civilians and 73,000 Afghan troops and police officers have lost their lives
                    since 2007.

                <h3>AMERICAN INVASION</h3>
                <p>Taliban held power in Afghanistan in 1996 and established sharia based Islamic rule until uprooted in
                    December 2001.</p>
                <p>
                    It was George Bush, the then president of the United States, who invaded Afghanistan with American
                    forces that led NATO with them. It was October 2001 when Bush said, “And now the Taliban will pay a
                    price. By destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for the
                    terror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a consequence of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when the Taliban regime refused to
                    hand over Osama bin laden, the mastermind and other Al-qaeda leaders to the United States. Bush
                    declared war on Afghanistan and established a transitional government and hence Karzai became the
                    president in 2001. Later a centralized democratic setup was also established with a constant push by
                    the west.

                <h3>AMERICAN PULL-OUT</h3>
                <p>
                    Only time will tell whether the American pullout from Afghanistan is somewhat closer to the Suez
                    canal crisis of 1956 from where the colour of the globe changed massively, imperial pink to a new
                    dawn. When the empire ended and the supremacy died until then it’s a war that ended with the U.S
                    being on the losing side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was not the Trump administration who initiated this pull back, it was Barack Obama first who
                    tried to indulge in talks with the Taliban and Afghan government in 2015 to bring back U.S troops
                    home. Meeting was hosted by another vital but cunning stakeholder Pakistan in Murree. Talks remain
                    inconclusive. Then comes the Trump administration that held talks with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar,
                    that led to the historic February 2020 agreement where from the United States the promise was made
                    to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021 whereas the Taliban promised to reduce
                    violence, involve in intra-Afghan peace talks, cut all ties with foreign terrorist outfits. After
                    the agreement was made American administration put pressure on Afghanistan to release Taliban
                    prisoners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Joe Biden became the U.S president he endorsed Trump’s agreement but extended the date of
                    withdrawal from may 1, 2021 to September 11 same year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the U.S troops are withdrawing but the Taliban-Afghanistan peace talk has been freezed since it
                    began in September 2020. The Taliban is still killing journalists, activists and civilians. It’s
                    terror connectivity beyond borders isn’t hidden anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conclusively, the only thing that can be said about this withdrawal is that the conditions has
                    worsened so much for the United States that it even doesn’t bother to put forth its conditions of
                    agreement impact fully, they realized that it is a war they couldn’t win but sadly it took 20 years
                    for the super power to accept the reality. It’s a permanent stain that will always hurt the United
                    States, at least Biden’s statement is indicating the same when he says, “I want to talk about happy
                    things. I’m not going to answer any more questions on Afghanistan.” Clearly, repercussions for
                    America from Afghan front are miserable.

                <h3>TALIBAN 2.O IN MAKING</h3>
                <p>
                    With almost 85,000 recruits and modernized weapons the Taliban are stronger than at any time and are
                    capable of spreading violence everywhere in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the Wall Street Journal, the American intelligence community predicted that Kabul could
                    fall within six months of U.S withdrawal. This could be proven by the facts that despite being half
                    of the Afghanistan forces, the Taliban has expanded rapidly and the work is going on. And in case
                    Kandahar took over Kabul, it will be the second time since the uprising of the Taliban that this
                    terror outfit will have the supremacy over Afghan territory. It’s quite easy for anyone to say that
                    there is no way that Afghan government and the Taliban will have a peace agreement, either there
                    will be a long term civil war or the Taliban will have an edge. Atleast, the current scenario has
                    inclined the balance of power in the Taliban’s favor. The Taliban is capturing key areas, be it many
                    vital districts, border areas with Pakistan, Iran, Uzbekistan. In a recent progression, Afghanistan
                    troops and a few Civilians have to flee to Tajikistan as the Taliban is imposing harsh sharia laws
                    in the areas under their control.

                <h3>IMPACT ON PAKISTAN AND CHINA</h3>
                <p>
                    Pakistan from the very emergence of the Taliban has been a key member of this whole scenario. Be it
                    diplomatic recognition or under the table support, Pakistan has always backed the Taliban.
                    Initially, it was official when Pakistan became the only third country after Saudi Arabia and
                    Turkmenistan to give the Taliban government a recognition but then after things changed under
                    pressure but the motto remains the same. Pakistan raised money, provided shelter, trained terrorists
                    and set the stage for what we are witnessing today. It’s good for Pakistan in one sense that it will
                    check the effective presence of India in Kabul but on the other hand the international isolation
                    will not serve the purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    China for a minute may see an opportunity there, but it knows that an Islamic government in Kabul
                    will empower the separatists that are brutally suppressed in Xinjiang province.

                <h3>IN INDIA’S CONTEXT</h3>
                <p>
                    If you’ll ask any rational Indian, the last thing one would like to hear is that the Taliban has
                    taken over Kabul. There are a lot of things at stake for India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Security is the biggest issue, India is already serving its traditional enemies at the Northern and
                    western front. One with an expansionist ideology and another with a terror mindset has already
                    harmed drastically. And if they get accompanied by the Taliban like outfit, who will not ban the
                    ISIS like establishment to flourish on their soil, it will be a major challenge for India provided
                    the infatuation of some religiously radical minds here to join those outfits.
                </p>
                <p>India’s investment in Afghanistan is nearly $3 billion, more than 400 projects in all the 34
                    districts are going on. It includes dams, schools, and hospitals. A few are already captured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Political instability, specifically in Jammu and Kashmir may become quite obvious as the separatist
                    leaders will definitely get backed up by those powers trying to disintegrate India and are in closer
                    vicinity to this Indian territory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diplomatic relations will definitely take a big dip because for India it will be a big decision to
                    recognize such a government. In recent progressions, India has already shut its two out of four
                    consultes temporarily in Jalalabad and Herat provinces whereas Kandahar consulate is in operation
                    only with the local staff after India evacuated its officials. The only Kabul Embassy is
                    operational. This shows that not only the Indian civilians living there in Afghanistan but the
                    officials as well are under serious threat.

                <h3>WHAT NEXT?</h3>
                <p>
                    Now it’s not a question about ‘if’ but ‘when’. If everything goes the way it’s going, very soon a
                    radical Islamic terrorist group will be there to decide the fate of a country, will ensure resource
                    management and of course will have a geopolitical role to play. The world must be ready for it.
